Computer Architecture:

Computer Architecture deals with giving operational attributes of the computer or Processor
to be specific. It deals with details like physical memory, ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) of
the processor, the number of bits used to represent the data types, Input Output mechanism
and technique for addressing memories.

Computer Organization:

Computer Organization is realization of what is specified by the computer architecture .It
deals with how operational attributes are linked together to meet the requirements specified
by computer architecture. Some organizational attributes are hardware details, control
signals, peripherals.

EXAMPLE:

Say you are in a company that manufactures cars, design and all low-level details of the car
come under computer architecture (abstract, programmers view), while making it’s parts
piece by piece and connecting together the different components of that car by keeping the
basic design in mind comes under computer organization (physical and visible).

GENERATIONS OF A COMPUTER
Generation in computer terminology is a change in technology a computer is/was being
used. Initially, the generation term was used to distinguish between varying hardware
technologies. But nowadays, generation includes both hardware and software, which
together make up an entire computer system.
There are totally five computer generations known till date. Each generation has been
discussed in detail along with their time period and characteristics. Here approximate dates
against each generations have been mentioned which are normally accepted.
Following are the main five generations of computers
S.N. Generation & Description
1 First Generation
The period of first generation: 1946-1959. Vacuum tube based.
2 Second Generation
The period of second generation: 1959-1965. Transistor based.
3 Third Generation
The period of third generation: 1965-1971. Integrated Circuit based.
4 Fourth Generation
The period of fourth generation: 1971-1980. VLSI microprocessor based.
5 Fifth Generation
The period of fifth generation: 1980-onwards. ULSI microprocessor based
